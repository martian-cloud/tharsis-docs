description: "What is Tharsis?"

A tool to deploy automated infrastructure in a consistent manner, and provide for separation of duties between products and business functions.

Tharsis builds on top of [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), i.e. it uses [Terraform modules](https://www.terraform.io/language/modules/develop) to deploy resources using environment-specific configuration. It stores the state data and outputs that can be used for other deployments.
